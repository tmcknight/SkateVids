# SkateVids

## Overview

SkateVids is a skateboard video channel for [Plex](http://plexapp.com). This channel retrieves videos from various YouTube/Vimeo feeds. You can view/modify which feeds are used in [sources.json](https://github.com/tmcknight/SkateVids/blob/master/SkateVids.bundle/Contents/Resources/sources.json).

## Installation

I'm hoping to get this into the official Plex app store, but for now you can install it manually.

1. Download the latest package.
2. Unzip.
3. Place SkateVids.bundle in Plex Media Server's plugins folder:
* Windows: C:\Users\%USER%\Appdata\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\
* OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/
